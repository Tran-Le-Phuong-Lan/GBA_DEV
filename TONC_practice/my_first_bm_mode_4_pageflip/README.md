# NOTE

- This project is a copy and modification from the original TONC code and the newer version TONC code (libtonc-examples).

  - The `Makefile` (copied from libtonc-examples) is modified to not to use the `/opt/devkit/libtonc`, but use the simplified-version of libtonc in the `./include` and `./source`. It helps the learning process much more fundamental.

  - The all the source codes in folder `./include` and `./source` are copied from the original TONC code.

  - The `./graphics` contains exact `<image>.png` from original TONC/ libtonc-examples. The file `./graphics/<image>.grit` is copied from libtonc-examples.
